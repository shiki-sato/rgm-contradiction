I am not sure what I would do without my brother. Lately I've been reading a fascinating novel called Ella Minnow Pea. It's quite interesting, I would recommend it if you like languages. It also would be a good one to keep your mom busy while she is recovering.", "Perfect, I will add it to her library list and check it out for her next week. Are you still dancing? Any luck getting into any shows?", "Yes, I am still dancing. I have had a few auditions lately, but nothing has panned out yet.

The other night he woke me up at 3am because he wanted to play. You should get Chunky a little kitty cat playmate", "My dog likes cats but I don't know. I think he would like it a little too much. Plus I'd feel bad that I couldn't bring the cat outside to play/walk/hike. Hopefully Snowballs leaves you alone enough to get some pages written for you bought.
